# DIY Types

The Contexture ecosystem provides a defined list of types that can be
used to perform a wide variety of different searches. Our types are
focused on the different search interfaces that we provide, but our
API is designed to allow you to build any type you might need for any
other possible use case you might encounter.  We believe in making a
generic framework so you can be creative on your search solutions.
Because of that, we will start this chapter by explaining how to build
your own types.
